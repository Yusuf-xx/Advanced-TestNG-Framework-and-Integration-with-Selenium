# Advanced-TestNG-Framework-and-Integration-with-Selenium
TestNG stands for Test Next Generation is a testing framework that provides the developer the ability to write more flexible and powerful tests with help of easy annotations, grouping, sequencing & parametrizing. It can easily be integrated with automation tools like Selenium and is widely used by automation test experts to write functional tests. In this one-hour guided project through hands-on, practical exercises, you will learn advanced concepts like executing test cases using testing xml file, grouping test cases, and performing data-driven testing.

# Project Structure
The hands-on project on Advanced TestNG Framework and Integration with Selenium  is divided into the following tasks:

    Task 1: Executing TestNG test cases using TestNG XML file
    Task 2: Executing methods before and after a test run or a test suite
    Task 3: Executing test cases of multiple classes via TestNG XML file
    Task 4: Executing test cases of all the classes of a package
    Task 5: Grouping test cases and executing them via TestNG XML file
    Task 6: Parameterizing test methods using @Paramters annotation
    Task 7: Parallel execution of test cases on multiple browsers using TestNG
    Task 8: Data-Driven testing using @DataProvider annotation
